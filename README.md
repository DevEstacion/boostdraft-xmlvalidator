# XmlValidator

## Summary
This XmlValidator uses the pattern of finding each closing tag (*finding the '</' characters*) then looking at a collected Stack that points to each found opening tag (*finding the '<' characters>*).

## Unit Tests
The project has a XmlValidator.Tests project where valid and invalid tests are written to further verify the integrity of the code. New test scenarios and cases can be added to these tests for additional coverage.

The test ensures that the current functionality remains consistent and future implementations doesn't break anything.

## Technology Used

* Rider
* VSCode
* .netcore 7.0
* C# 11
